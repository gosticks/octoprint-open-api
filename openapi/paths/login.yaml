  summary: Login
  description: >-
    Creates a login session or retrieves information about the currently existing session (“passive login”).
    Can be used in one of two ways: to login a user via username and password and create a persistent session (usually from a UI in the browser), or to retrieve information about the active user (from an existing session or an API key) via the passive flag.
    Will return a 200 OK with a login response on successful login, whether active or passive. The active (username/password) login may also return a 403 Forbidden in case of a username/password mismatch, unknown user or a deactivated account.
