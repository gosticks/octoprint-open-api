  Other than most of the other requests on OctoPrintâ€™s API which are expected as JSON, this request is expected as Content-Type: multipart/form-data due to the included file upload.

  To upload a file, the request body must contain the file form field with the contents and file name of the file to upload.

  Only files with one of the extensions zip, tar.gz, tgz or tar will be processed, for other file extensions a 400 Bad Request will be returned.

  Will return a list of installed language packs upon completion, as described in Retrieve installed language packs.
