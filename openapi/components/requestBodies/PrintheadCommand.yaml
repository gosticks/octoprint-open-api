            Jogs the print head (relatively) by a defined amount in one or more axes.
          properties:
            command:
              type: string
              enum:
                - axis

              type: number
              description: >-
                Optional. Amount/coordinate to jog print head on x axis, must be a valid number corresponding to the distance to travel in mm.
            y:
              type: number
              description: >-
                Optional. Amount/coordinate to jog print head on y axis, must be a valid number corresponding to the distance to travel in mm.
            z:
              type: number
              description: Optional. Amount/coordinate to jog print head on z axis, must be a valid number corresponding to the distance to travel in mm.
            absolute:
              type: number
              description: >-
                Optional. Boolean value specifying whether to move relative to current position (provided axes values are relative amounts) or to absolute position (provided axes values are coordinates)
            speed:
              type: number
              description: >-
                Optional. Speed at which to move. If not provided, minimum speed for all selected axes from printer profile will be used. If provided but false, no speed parameter will be appended to the command. Otherwise interpreted as an integer signifying the speed in mm/min, to append to the command.
