    description: >-
      Origin of the current time left estimate.
      - linear: based on an linear approximation of the progress in file in bytes vs time
      - analysis: based on an analysis of the file
      - estimate: calculated estimate after stabilization of linear estimation
      - average: based on the average total from past prints of the same model against the same printer profile
      - mixed-analysis: mixture of estimate and analysis
      - mixed-average: mixture of estimate and average
